Supply Chains across the world are broken today post COVID as ERP data exists in silos. Further the data is hugely dependent on human interactions. Though data capture is automated at bigger companies, the vendors at the lower end are still dependent on manual processes.

E.g., Typically in a Supply Chain there would be approx 20 touchpoints before the product reaches the end customer from the factory. This includes several resellers, unorganised vendors and individual transport vehicle owners. Only the top 3 to 5 vendors in the above chain have organised data which still exists in silos without any trustable data exchange protocols.
